## Object Detection using YOLO

### Description
This part of the project is dedicated to object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once), with a primary focus on license plate detection. YOLO is an efficient real-time object detection system known for its speed and accuracy. The code for this implementation can be found in the 'yolo_object_detection' directory.

### Usage

- To put the provided YOLO object detection to work for identifying license plates:
- Start with the Code: Use the code we've shared in the repository.
- Train Your Model: Get a dataset formatted for YOLOv8 and train the model. We've designed the code to be compatible with this format for a seamless experience.
- Run the Detector: Once the model is trained, simply run the provided script to detect license plates in any new image you choose.


Enjoy the straightforward process and the power of YOLO for your license plate detection tasks!
### Dependencies
The YOLO object detection component relies on the following:
- Python
- Libraries specified in 'requirements.txt' within the 'yolo_object_detection' directory.
